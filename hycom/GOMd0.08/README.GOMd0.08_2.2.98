This tar bundle contains the files needed to run a nested GOMd0.08 case
with HYCOM version 2.2.98 and CFSR atmospheric forcing (including 10m winds, 
downward radiation fields and surface pressure).  It assumes that you already 
have GOMd0.08 configured for the standard expt_06.0 case (version 2.1.20), 
and most data files are from that case.  However, 30.6 uses CFSR forcing
and so you also need forcing_cfsrDW_099.tar.gz to replace the old NOGAPS
forcing.  Note that many blkdat.input variables for expt_30.6 are set at 
different values than in 06.0.  The new values are nearer to what we now 
typically use at 1/12 degree.

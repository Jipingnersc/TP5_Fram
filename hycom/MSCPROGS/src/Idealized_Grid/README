Routines for generating idealized grid configurations. These routines are
only meant as starting points. They will have to be hand-modified for your own
idealized setup.

igrid   : Creates regional.grid/depth.[ab] files describing periodic
          flat bottom or seamount cases. Modify for more advanced setups

irstrt  : Can be used to create an initial restart file. Two simple 
          cases are in the file. Use them as starting points for your 
          own setups

iforce  : Idealized forcing - TODO

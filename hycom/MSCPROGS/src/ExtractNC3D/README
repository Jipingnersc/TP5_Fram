Directory contains routines for converting from .[ab] files
to netcdf file (tmp1.nc). An evolution of the ExtractNC2D 
routines

h2nc :
   m2nc will extract data from hycom .[ab] files
   and put these into netcdf file tmp1.nc.
   The fields to extract are specified in extract
   files which corresponds to the file type you 
   want to extract from (for example extract.daily, 
   extract.restart ...). Sample extract files can 
   be found in Input directory under MSCProgs directory
   
   Several files can be specified which results in 
   several time records in the netcdf file

   Vectors can be rotated, depending on the flags in
   extract-files (TODO!)

   usage:  h2nc  file(s)

   NB: files contains isopycnal layer values, no vertical 
   interpolation.

   The main difference between this and m2nc is that relevant fields are 
   dumped into 3D netcdf variables. m2nc will dump everything into
   2D variables.

This directory contains routines for interpolating from a hycom-type climatology
to netcdf format similar to Hyc2proj. It relies on input routines found in the "ALL"
directory of the standard hycom distribution - These are set in the main script 
"GDEMtomodel.sh". This script can easily be converted to other hycom climatology 
input files (change location of ZINT  and location of data files (.d)

Routines:
PHCtomodel.sh  : Main script that ties everything together - links in 
                 climatology files, does the horizontal interpolation of
                 the z-level climatology to the hycom grid. Intermediate output is on 
                 the hycom model grid, in files of type saln_sig0_monthXX.[ab].
                 These files are then processed in the script by using  two routines 
                 below (hclimlevels and hclimtonc).

GDEMtomodel.sh  : Same as the above, but for the GDEM climatology (needs a tune-up)


hclimlevels    : Reads the hycom climatology files, and retrieves the available
                 depth levels in those files. No input, but assumes file t_m01.d
                 is present

hclimtonc      : Routine reads horizontally interpolated z-level climatology
                 produced by hycom "ALL" routines. The climatology is interpolated
                 to grid specified by proj.in - similar to "hyc2proj" routines
                 input is month and depthlevel(s)

NB: Run this in a seperate directory to avoid clutter/mishaps

You should have this ready:
grid.info
regional.grid.[ab]
regional.depth.[ab]
proj.in (specifies projection for mod_toproj)
blkdat.input
environment variable HYCOMCLIM_PATH must point to the climatology (.d - files). Note that
this is path different for PHC and GDEM climatologies


Good Luck

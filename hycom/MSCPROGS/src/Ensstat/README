In this directory are routines for calculating correlation between model fields.

ensstat_field :
   Takes as input two model variables (field1 and field2), along with
   two layer indexes (k1 and k2), and calculates the correlation between
   these two for every point on the model grid for a set of hycom 
   input files. Run without arguments for more info

ensstat_point :
   Similar to the above, but also takes a grid location (x,y) as input. 
   It then correlates variable at(field1,k1) at all grid locations
   with variable at (field2,k2) at grid location (x,y).
   Run without arguments for more info

ensstat_field3D.sh : 
   Wrapper around ensstat_field, input field1 is now treated as
   a 3D variable. The script goes through all layers for this variable, 
   creating a 3D file with correlation against (field2,k2) for all
   layers of field1.
   Run without arguments for more info

ensstat_point3D.sh :
   Wrapper around ensstat_point, input field1 is now treated as
   a 3D variable. The script goes through all layers for this variable, 
   creating a 3D file with correlation against (field2,k2) at (x,y) 
   for all layers of field1.
   Run without arguments for more info

NB: the scripts require the nco tools to work.
TODO: blank out empty layers(?)

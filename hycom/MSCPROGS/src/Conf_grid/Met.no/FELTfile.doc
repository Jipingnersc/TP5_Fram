At met.no there are two types of FELTfiles, a DIRECT ACCESS type which are used for graphics and
processing, and a SEQUENTIAL type which is the first (last) step after (before) model output (input).

The most convenient format for you should be the SEQUENTIAL type. In short, on this type of files
the information is stored as 16 bit INTEGER words. By this procedure the actual values must be in
the range: -32767 <= value < +32767. Thus, to achive the wanted accuracy, the values must be
scaled. Example; a value of 34.67 for salinity will have the value 3467 in the SEQUENTIAL FELTfile,
and is thereby scaled by 100.

On the SEQUENTIAL FELTfiles the information is stored as:

Field identification (20 words)
Field values (nx * ny words, where nx,ny are the field dimensions)
Field identification (20 words)
Field values (nx * ny words, where nx,ny are the field dimensions)
Field identification (20 words)
Field values (nx * ny words, where nx,ny are the field dimensions)
.
.
.
etc

(In special cases there might also be some words of field identification AFTER the field values).

The 20 words of field identification is ( ident(20) ):

1: Producer (met.no=88, ECMEF=98, UK Met.Off.=74, etc.)
2: Grid number (to be chosen. Here = 948)
3: Datatype (Parameterfields = 4, analysis = 1, prognoses = 2)
4: Hours from analysis time (positive or negative)
5: Vertical coordinate type (surface = 8, sigma = 7, z-coordinates = 5, isopycnal = ?)
6: Parameter (bottom topography = 351, u-current = 302, v-current = 303, salt = 307, temp = 308, etc.)
7: Value of vertical coordinate (if ident(5)=5, then ident(7)=100 means 100m depth)
8: Reference value of vertical coordinate (usually = 0)
9: Type of grid (Polarstereographic = 1, Spherical = 2, etc.)
10:Numbers of grid points along x-axis
11:Numbers of grid points along y-axis
12:Reference year (format:yyyy, i.e. four digits)
13:Month*100 + Day (e.g. November 24. = 1124)
14:Hour*100
15:x-coordinate of the North Pole (NB only if Polarstereographic grid)  
16:y-coordinate of the North Pole (NB only if Polarstereographic grid)  
17:Grid size in km*10 (NB only if Polarstereographic grid, may also be negative)  
18:Longitude parallel to the y-axis (NB only if Polarstereographic grid)  
19:Flag (= 0)
20:Exponential scaling factor (E). True value = Stored value * 10.**E

NB If Polarstereographic grid, sometimes the parameter *AN* is requested. It is computed
   as: AN = (79.*150)/(ABS(ident(17)*0.1)). For a 4km grid with ident(17)=-40, then
   AN = 11850/4 = 2962.5

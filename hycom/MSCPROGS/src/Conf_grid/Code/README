This directory contains routines for generating a bathymetry
for various data sets. Currently supported bathymetries are:
GEBCO  (global)
ETOPO5 (global)
BODC   (regional)
IBCAO  (regional)
CONMAN (regional)

This version of conf_grid need you to specify the location of 
topographies through environment variables. If the grid routine 
cant find the files you will get some clues as you run the routine.
These environment variables point to bathymetry dataset paths
GEBCO_PATH 
ETOPO5_PATH
BODC_PATH  
IBCAO_PATH 
CONMAN_PATH

To use these bathymetries you must set them in the infile 
grid.bathy (an example can be found in the directory above 
this one.

To specify the region you want a bathymetry for you must
edit the file grid.info. It uses the conformal mapping 
routines of Bentsen et al (1999) to calculate the spatial
location of grid nodes.

Finally the topography must be hand-corrected to modify
the final topography (remove isolated basins, correct 
depth in critical locations etc ).

The matlab routine "showconfmap" can be of some assistance 
for setting up a new grid. It is located in the Matlab directory.
Set the "grid.info" routine to not dump a topography(so that grid 
runs faster), then run showconfmap to visualize the bathymetry 
(mainly meant for rough placement of the model grid). When the 
bathymetry has roughly the correct placement, switch on the topo flag
in grid.info, and fine tune through other means. A netcdf and a tecplot
diagnostic file is available for this purpose (confgrid.tec/nc).

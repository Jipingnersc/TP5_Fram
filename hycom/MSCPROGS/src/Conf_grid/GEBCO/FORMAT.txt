GEBCO One Minute Grid - Data Format


The GEBCO grid is one minute of latitude by one minute of
longitude, stored in grid line registration format. The data are
stored in NetCDF as a one dimensional array of 2-byte signed
integers that represent integer elevations in metres with the
convention that bathymetric depths have negative values and
topographic heights have positive values. Information concerning
NetCDF can be found at the URL:
http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/.

The NetCDF file is compatible with the GMT (Generic Mapping Tools)
system (http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/).

The data cover the area 90°N - 90°S; 180°W - 180°E

There are 21601 x 10801 data values, one for each one minute of
latitude and longitude for 233312401 points.

The data start at position 90°N, 180°W and are arranged in bands of
360 degrees x 60 points/degrees + 1 = 21601 values. The data range
eastward from 180°W longitude to 180°E longitude, i.e the 180° value
is repeated.

The data can be exported through the GDA software interface in
this format and also as simple ASCII files.

Dear Professor Evensen,

Meirion has asked me to email you with the details for accessing the
AMMP gridded bathymetry data via ftp. The details are as follows:

ftp to '  ftp.pol.ac.uk '

login as anonymous  and use your email id as a password

once logged in cd to /pub/bodc/requests/paw/ammp

the command "  ls " will show you the files available.

The directory contains the following files:

1. ASCII version of the gridded bathymetry file:   ammp_bathy.dat

2. Word for Windows format documentation file including a description
of the data file format:  ammp.doc 

The directory also contains 3 Postscript format files which contain
the images for the annexes refered to in the documentation file.

bathy_tr.ps  -  shows the trackline control coverage
bathy_ctr.ps - 100m interval contours derived from the bathymetric
grid
bathy_limits - the geographic limits of the various data sets used to
produce the gridded data set.

Please let me know if you have any problems accessing the files.

Yours sincerely,

Pauline Weatherall

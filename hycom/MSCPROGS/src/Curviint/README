This directory contains routines for interpolating from an outer model to a
regional model.


curviint-2.1 : 
   This routine interpolates from the outer model grid to the
   regional model. It uses the "old" type of grid and depths 
   file (newpos, depthsXXXxXXX.uf). You have to write the name
   of the restart file to process, grid dimensions etc as the
   program runs. More detailed instructions are available when 
   running the program


curviint-2.2 :
   This routine interpolates from the outer model grid to the
   regional model. It uses standard hycom grid and depths files,
   where the outer model grid/depth is renamed to global.depth.[ab]
   and global.grid.[ab]. Grid dimensions are automatically
   retrieved from those two files. File name of hycom restart file
   and ICE restart file are given as arguments to this routine
   More detailed instructions are available when running the program
   with no arguments.

   NB: Despite the name this routine can be used on old hycom restart
   files as long as you have regional.grid/depths files.


NB: Run this program in a separate subdirectory to avoid unfortunate
side-effects.

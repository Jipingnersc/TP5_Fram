Directory contains routines for converting from .[ab] files
to netcdf file (tmp1.nc) and tecplot file (tmp1).

m2nc :
   m2nc will extract data from hycom .[ab] files
   and put these into netcdf file tmp1.nc.
   The fields to extract are specified in extract
   files which corresponds to the file type you 
   want to extract from (for example extract.daily, 
   extract.restart ...). Sample extract files can 
   be found in Input directory under MSCProgs directory

   
   Several files can be specified which results in 
   several time records in the netcdf file.  Vectors 
   can be rotated, depending on the flags in extract-files 

   usage:  m2nc  file(s)

   NB: files contains isopycnal layer values, no vertical 
   interpolation.

m2t :
   same as m2nc but also creates a tecplot file tmp1. 
   This routine basically calls m2nc with a "tecplot-flag".
   Somewhat slower than m2nc.

tec_nc_conv:
   The routine doing all the heavy lifting, called from
   the m2nc routine. Reads .ab files, extract files and 
   dumps the fields into netcdf and tecplot files.
